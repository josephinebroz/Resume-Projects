        "The `lunar_crater_data.csv` data has two columns: first, the \"crater ID number\" and, second, the diameter of the crater in meters. This data was is part of the [Lunar Crater Database](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Moon/Research/Craters/lunar_crater_database_robbins_2018#:~:text=Product%20Information%3A,diameter%20(Robbins%2C%202018)) which contains approximately 1.3 million lunar impact craters and is approximately complete for all craters larger than about 1–2 km in diameter.\n",

        "How do we quantify how \"frequently\" the different crater diameters occur? We can use a statistical tool called a \"histogram\" to begin to answer this.\n",
        "\n",
        "A histogram splits the data up into different intervals called \"bins\": for example, perhaps we group all the of the craters with a diameter from 0 up to 1m, and then all the craters from 1m up to 2m, etc. Then we graph how many craters are in each bin, which tells us which crater types occur most frequently.\n",

        "For now, let's just focus on one very important point about histograms. You get to CHOOSE how many \"bins\" to use (and hence, how many points will be on the plot). This is a complicated decision-- too few points, and you'll have very litte data, but too many and yor data may become unnaturally noisy.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll explore that a little today and in more detail later in the course. For now let's arbitrarily choose to make a histogram with 10 bins.\n"

        "$$F = kd^\\alpha$$\n",

        "\n",

        "1. Take the log of both $F$ and $d$. These data are now linear.\n",
        "2. Find the best-fit line for this linear data. The slope of this line is just alpha! Do you see this in the equation above?\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        " This procedure is nice because fitting straight lines and extracting slopes is particularly easy in Python. We could also use the intercept of the best-fit line to find $k$, if we wanted. Then we'd know the *exact* power law for this situation.\n",
        "\n",
        " We'll find the best-fit line using a function called \"linregress\". Linregress takes in our x- and y- data and gives us back four things: the slope of the best-fit line, the intercept of the best-fit line, and thre other statistical parameters (called the \"r\", \"p\", and \"s\" values) that we don't need today.  \n",
        "\n",
