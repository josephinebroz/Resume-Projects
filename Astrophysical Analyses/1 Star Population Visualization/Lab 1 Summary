In this project, I created a color-magnitude diagram using Gaia DR2 data, allowing me to classify and analyze stellar populations in the Milky Way.

Objectives:
- Create a color-magnitude diagram using Gaia DR2 data.
- Analyze and classify stellar populations.
- Apply astrophysical principles to real data.
- Practice data filtering and visualization techniques.
- Interpret stellar characteristics and distributions.

Part 1: Read in the Data
- Downloaded Gaia DR2 data and imported it into a pandas DataFrame.

Part 2: Inspect Data
- Check the imported data by viewing column names and some sample values to ensure it matches the Gaia documentation.

Part 3: Filter the Data
- Create a new DataFrame with relevant columns (parallax, parallax over error, photometric flux, and color index).
- Remove rows with missing values in these columns.

Part 4: Calculate Photometric Color
- Extract the color index from the filtered DataFrame and store it in a separate variable.

Part 5: Calculate Distances and Absolute Magnitudes
- Compute distances to stars using the parallax values from the Gaia data.
- Convert parallax measurements to distances in parsecs.
- Transform the apparent magnitudes of stars to absolute magnitudes using the distance modulus formula.

Part 7: Signal-to-Noise Cut
- Filter the data to keep only stars with a parallax over error ratio greater than 4.0 for accuracy.
- Use a boolean index to select "good" data points.

Part 8: Create Color-Magnitude Diagram
- Plot the color-magnitude diagram with color index on the x-axis and absolute magnitude on the y-axis.
- Reverse the y-axis to have brighter stars at the top.

a. Peer Review
- Compared plots with peers and noted any differences or similarities.
b. Axis Interpretation
- Explained what the x- and y-axes represented in terms of stellar properties (color and absolute magnitude).
- Identified the locations of the hottest and brightest stars.
c. Stellar Radius
- Infered stellar radii based on the diagram and temperature definitions.
- Identified where the largest and smallest stars are located on the diagram.
d. Stellar Populations
- Identified different populations of stars (main sequence, giants, supergiants, white dwarfs).
- Discussed which populations contain the most stars and their significance.
