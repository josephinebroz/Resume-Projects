In this project, we explored the physics of photoionized regions around newly formed stars or white dwarfs, focusing on calculating the Strömgren radius, analyzing 
nebular spectra, and comparing theoretical models with numerical calculations.

Objectives:
- Understand the formation and properties of Strömgren spheres in photoionized regions.
- Calculate the Strömgren radius for ionized hydrogen and helium zones.
- Compare theoretical predictions with numerical results from the Cloudy code.
- Analyze the differences between incident stellar spectra and observed nebular spectra.

Part 1: Strömgren Sphere of Ionized Gas Surrounding a Massive Star
a. Total Ionization Rate: Determined the total ionization rate inside the Strömgren sphere is Q* as all ionizing photons are absorbed.
b. Total Recombination Rate: Calculated the total recombination rate within the Strömgren sphere per unit volume.

Part 2: Typical Size of a Photoionized Nebula
- Calculated the ionizing photon rate for a star with given effective temperature and radius.
- Determined the Strömgren radius in cm and compare it to the size of the star and the width of a Galactic spiral arm.

Part 3: Thickness of the Transition from Ionized to Neutral
- Estimated the thickness of the boundary where gas transitions from fully ionized to neutral using the mean free path of an ionizing photon.
- Compared the mean free path with the Strömgren radius to assess the sharpness of the transition.

Part 4: Relative Size of Hydrogen and Helium Ionization Zones
- Calculated the ratio of the radius of helium to hydrogen ionization zones.
- Used the Strömgren sphere model to find this ratio based on ionizing photon rates and composition parameters.

Part 5: Comparison to Numerical Calculation with Cloudy Code
- Compared the calculated Strömgren radius with the Cloudy code output, which tracks ionization states and temperatures in the nebula.
- Plotted the ionization fractions for hydrogen and helium, and compared these with the theoretical Strömgren radius values.
- Assessed the accuracy of the Strömgren sphere assumption based on the fractional error compared to Cloudy results.

Part 6: Nebular Spectrum
- Compared the incident stellar spectrum with the observed spectrum from the entire nebula.
- Analyzed the differences, noting the reduction in high-energy flux in the observed spectrum.
- Explained that the energy from the star is absorbed and re-emitted by the ionized gas in the nebula, distorting the received flux.
