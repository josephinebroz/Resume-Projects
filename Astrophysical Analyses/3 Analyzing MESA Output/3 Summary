In this project, we analyzed MESA output data to study the evolution of a Sun-like star, focusing on its main sequence phase, structural changes, and post-main sequence behavior.

Objectives:
- Analyze the evolution of a Sun-like star using MESA output data.
- Identify the main sequence phase and subsequent stellar evolution stages.
- Examine changes in stellar structure, composition, and energy generation over time.
- Compare theoretical predictions with observed data.

Part 1: Load Time Series Data
- Load the MESA output data into an object and list all the possible variables.

Part 2: Identify the Main Sequence Phase
- Plot various parameters (core temperature, core mass density, surface luminosity, effective temperature, stellar radius) against time to identify the main 
  sequence phase.
- Determined where hydrogen burning starts in the core and where the star leaves the main sequence.

Part 3: Radial Structure of the Main Sequence Star
- Analyzed the radial structure of the star during the main sequence phase.
a. Outer Boundary of the Core: Identified the outer boundary of the core based on the radius, approximately 1/4 of the stellar radius.
b. Enclosed Mass in the Core: Estimated the fraction of the star's mass enclosed in the core, approximately 30-35%.
c. Core Temperature and Energy Generation: Confirmed that the conditions are typical for a main sequence star, with core temperature around 10 million K and energy 
   generation similar to the Sun.
d. Density Profile Comparison: Compared the density profile to previous assumptions, noting the increase in density as the star evolves.

Part 4: Post-Main Sequence Changes
- Examined changes in the star's composition and structure as it leaves the main sequence.
a. Hydrogen to Helium Conversion: Determined if most hydrogen is converted to helium during the main sequence.
b. Core Temperature and Nuclear Fuel: Checked if the core is hot enough to burn helium and identify the nuclear fuel being consumed.
c. Stellar Phase Identification: Determined the star's phase based on its location on the HR diagram and radius, likely entering the red giant phase.

Part 5: Radial Structure After Leaving the Main Sequence
- Compared the star's radial structure before and after leaving the main sequence.
a. Changes in Density and Radius: Analyzed the changes in central and surface density, total radius, and mass, noting significant increases in radius and core 
   density.
b. Core Composition and Fusion: Studied the changes in core composition, fusion location, and the main nuclear reaction chain, observing the shift from hydrogen to 
   helium burning and the increase in energy generation rate.
Part 6: Summary and Further Evolution
- Discussed the further evolution of the star, including the helium flash and subsequent phases.
a. Helium Fusion: Identified when helium starts fusing in the core, noting discrepancies in core temperature expectations.
b. Shorter Phases Post-Main Sequence: Explained why post-main sequence phases are shorter due to rapid changes in core temperature and fuel consumption, leading to 
   faster evolution and the star's eventual end stages.
