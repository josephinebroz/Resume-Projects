This experiment aimed to find the mass and lifetime of the K0 meson by analyzing tracks in bubble chamber pictures and applying fundamental physics laws such as 
conservation of energy and momentum.

Objectives:
- Measure the magnetic field using the K+ meson tracks.
- Calculate the rest mass energy of the K0 meson.
- Determine the lifetime of the K0 meson.
- Analyze sources of error and uncertainties in measurements.

Part 1: Introduction
- Found the mass and lifetime of the K0 meson using bubble chamber pictures.
- Applied conservation of energy and momentum principles.

Part 2: Experimental Procedure
- Calculated the magnetic field based on K+ meson tracks.
- Measured radii of curvature and angles for pion tracks.
- Used measurements to calculate the K0 meson's rest mass energy and lifetime.

Part 3: Results
- Calculated rest mass energy values for each event, averaging 488.4 MeV.
- Determined K0 meson lifetime values, averaging 2.25e-11 s.
- Compared results with accepted values and analyzed uncertainties.

Part 4: Data Analysis
- Performed detailed calculations using the measured data.
- Estimated systematic uncertainties and propagated errors.

Part 5: Discussion and Conclusion
- Discussed accuracy of calculated values and sources of error.
- Concluded that measurements were close to accepted values despite uncertainties.
