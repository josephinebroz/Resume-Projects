This experiment aimed to demonstrate the photoelectric effect and calculate Planck's constant by measuring the relationship
between stopping voltage and frequency of incident light. Performed in Mathematica

Objectives:
- Demonstrate the photoelectric effect.
- Measure the stopping voltage for various wavelengths.
- Calculate Planck's constant using the measured data.
- Analyze sources of error and uncertainty in measurements.

Part 1: Introduction
- Demonstrated the photoelectric effect by observing electrons escaping from a metal when hit by light.
- Calculated Planck's constant by measuring the cutoff voltage and multiplying it by the electron charge.

Part 2: Experimental Procedure
- Used a mercury lamp and photo tube to measure dark current, stopping voltage, and photo current.
- Collected data for various wavelengths and aperture sizes.

Part 3: Results
- Recorded relationships between dark current and voltage, stopping voltage and frequency, and photo current and incident light.
- Calculated Planck's constant from the experimental data.

Part 4: Data Analysis
- Performed calculations and statistical analysis to determine Planck's constant.
- Analyzed sources of error including equipment stability and measurement uncertainties.

Part 5: Discussion and Conclusion
- Confirmed the calculated value of Planck's constant (1.3617 Ã— 10^-30 m^2kgs^-1) was in agreement with the accepted value.
- Identified sources of error and their impact on the results.
