This experiment aimed to demonstrate the existence of Bohr atomic energy levels by observing energy losses of electrons 
colliding with argon atoms and calculating Planck's constant from the first excitation potential of argon. Performed in 
Mathematica.

Objectives:
- Demonstrate Bohr atomic energy levels.
- Measure excitation potentials using a Frank-Hertz apparatus.
- Calculate Planck's constant from experimental data.
- Analyze systematic and random errors in measurements.
Part 1: Introduction
- Demonstrated Bohr atomic energy levels by observing electron energy losses in argon.

Part 2: Experimental Procedure
- Used a Frank-Hertz apparatus and oscilloscope to plot current vs grid voltage.
- Adjusted apparatus settings and recorded data for voltage ranging from 0 to 90 volts.

Part 3: Results
- Calculated the mean of excitation values (10.9271 V).
- Determined Planck's constant (6.2166 × 10^-34 J/s) from experimental data.
- Compared the calculated value with the accepted value (6.626 × 10^-34 J/s).

Part 4: Data Analysis
- Performed uncertainty propagation and calculated systematic and random errors.
- Identified sources of error including differences in data reading and knob adjustments.

Part 5: Conclusion
- Confirmed the calculated Planck's constant closely agreed with the accepted value.
- Gained insights into the energy levels of electrons in argon and the existence of Bohr atomic energy levels.
