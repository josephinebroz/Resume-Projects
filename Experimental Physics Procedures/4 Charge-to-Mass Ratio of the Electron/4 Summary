This experiment aimed to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron using an e/m tube by manipulating the current and 
measuring the resulting electron beam deflection.

Objectives:
- Calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron.
- Use an e/m tube to measure beam deflection.
- Analyze systematic and random errors in the experiment.

Part 1: Introduction
- Calculated the charge-to-mass ratio of an electron using an e/m tube.

Part 2: Experimental Procedure
- Set up the e/m apparatus and aligned it with the compass.
- Adjusted power supplies and recorded currents at different voltages.
- Measured current values for various crossbar positions.

Part 3: Results
- Calculated average current values and subtracted baseline current.
- Used measurements and constants to compute e/m values.
- Averaged e/m values and compared with accepted value.

Part 4: Data Analysis
- Analyzed measurements and calculated standard deviation for random errors.
- Evaluated systematic uncertainties including voltmeter and meter stick accuracy.

Part 5: Discussion and Conclusion
- Concluded that the experimental e/m value (1.76 x 10^11 C/kg) agreed with the accepted value.
- Identified and discussed sources of error and their impact on results.

Appendix
- Included scanned sheets from the lab notebook for detailed reference.
