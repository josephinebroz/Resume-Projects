This experiment aimed to measure the wavelength of light from a He-Ne laser and the index of refraction of air using a 
Michelson interferometer. All analysis done in Wolfram Mathematica.

Objectives:
- Measure the wavelength of the He-Ne laser.
- Calculate the index of refraction of air.
- Analyze sources of error and uncertainties in the experiment.

Part 1: Introduction
- Observed and calculated different wavelengths and the refraction index of air using an He-Ne laser.

Part 2: Experimental Procedure
- Utilized an interferometer with an He-Ne laser to measure wavelengths by observing constructive and destructive interference.
- Conducted experiments with the sodium doublet to measure wavelength changes.
- Measured the index of refraction of air using a vacuum cell.

Part 3: Results
- Calculated the wavelength of the He-Ne laser (6390 ± 70 angstroms).
- Measured the sodium doublet wavelength (7.11 ± 0.9 angstroms).
- Determined the index of refraction of air (1.00023 ± 0.00005).

Part 4: Discussion and Conclusion
- Discussed agreement of measured values with accepted values and identified sources of error, including fringe visibility and human error.
- Concluded that the experiment provided values close to accepted standards with identified uncertainties.

Appendix
- Included scanned lab notebook sheets for detailed reference.
