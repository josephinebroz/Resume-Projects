This lab aimed to find Planck's constant using the emission spectra from the Balmer series of Hydrogen, involving spectrometer alignment, angular measurements, and
wavelength calculations.

Objectives:
- Use a spectrometer to observe emission spectra.
- Measure angular positions of spectral lines.
- Calculate wavelengths and use them to determine Planck's constant.
- Analyze sources of error and uncertainty in measurements.

Part 1: Introduction
- Found Planckâ€™s constant using the emission spectra from the Balmer series of Hydrogen.
- Observed emission spectra of Mercury, Hydrogen, and Helium using a spectrometer.

Part 2: Experimental Procedure
- Aligned and focused the spectrometer facing the Mercury lamp.
- Turned the lamp on, positioned the magnifying lens, and observed emission lines.
- Recorded angular measurements for each emission line.

Part 3: Results
- Measured and recorded angular positions for spectral lines of Mercury, Hydrogen, and Helium.
- Converted angular measurements to wavelengths and calculated Planck's constant.

Part 4: Data Analysis
- Performed calculations and statistical analysis to estimate Planck's constant.
- Analyzed systematic uncertainties and potential sources of error.

Part 5: Discussion and Conclusion
- Discussed deviations from the accepted value of Planck's constant and the impact of experimental errors.
- Concluded that while the calculated value was not accurate, the experiment provided insights into measurement techniques and error analysis.


Included scanned sheets from the lab notebook and additional data analysis using Wolfram Mathematica.
