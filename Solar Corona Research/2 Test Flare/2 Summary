This packet introduces the process of determining the total energy of the X8.2-class solar flare that occurred on September 10th, 2017, using Python programming 
and data analysis techniques in Python.

Objectives:
- Import and preprocess solar flare data.
- Perform baseline correction for accurate energy measurements.
- Integrate power as a function of time to find total flare energy.
- Document the process using markdown cells and comments.

Part 1: Data Import and Preprocessing
- Import XRS longwave data of the X8.2-class solar flare.
- Convert units of irradiance and time for analysis.

Part 2: Plotting the Solar Flare Data
- Plot solar flare data as energy per second versus time.

Part 3: Baseline Correction
- Determine the baseline correction for the solar flare data.

Part 4: Plotting with Baseline Correction
- Plot data with baseline removed to highlight the flare's energy.

Part 5: Integration to Find Total Energy
- Integrate the power as a function of time to find the total energy.
