This packet guides the analysis of a solar flare chosen by Heather Lewindowsky from the Space Weather Data Portal to calculate the flare's total energy using Python
data analysis techniques.

Objectives:
- Select and describe a solar flare for analysis.
- Import and preprocess flare data.
- Perform baseline correction to isolate flare energy.
- Integrate power as a function of time to determine total energy.
- Document the process with markdown cells and comments.

Part 1: Flare Selection and Description
- Find assigned flare on the Space Weather Data Portal.
- Provided a description and unique name for the flare.
- Downloaded flare data as a CSV file.

Part 2: Data Import and Preprocessing
- Imported the flare data using pandas.
- Converted units of irradiance and time for analysis.

Part 3: Plotting the Solar Flare Data
- Plotted solar flare data as energy per second versus time to visualize the flare.

Part 4: Baseline Correction
- Determined and subtract the baseline level of x-rays to isolate the flare's energy.

Part 5: Integration to Find Total Energy
- Integrated the power as a function of time to find the total energy.
- Used the integrate.trapz() function for accurate integration.
